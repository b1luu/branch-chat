# Progress log

Newest entries at the bottom. Each sprint appends one entry (format in CLAUDE.md).

## 2026-10-27 18:15 UTC — setup
- Status: green (nothing built yet)
- Done: added SPEC.md, BACKLOG.md, CLAUDE.md, PROGRESS.md
- Decisions: FastAPI + React; mock LLM provider in tests; SQLite for tests, Postgres for real use
- Next: B1

## 2026-10-27 19:46 UTC — B1
- Status: red (on wip/B1) — environment blocker, not a code failure
- Done: wrote backend scaffold (pyproject with ruff/pytest/pytest-asyncio/httpx, FastAPI app factory, `/healthz`, healthz test, app/{api,db,llm,services} packages). `ruff check .` passes. Pushed to `wip/B1` (2be26a7).
- Error: `pip`/`uv` install of fastapi failed: `Tunnel connection failed: 403 Forbidden` for pypi.org (direct DNS to pypi.org also fails). Proxy status shows `connect_rejected ... host: pypi.org:443`. Without fastapi, pytest fails at collection (`ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'fastapi'`).
- Tried: uv install, pip install, pip via proxy with pypi removed from NO_PROXY, searched local caches for wheels. No fix possible from inside the sandbox; did not count against the 5 code-fix attempts.
- Decisions: did not mark B1 BLOCKED in BACKLOG (it's the cloud environment, not the item). Did not merge wip/B1 to main because tests couldn't run. Next sprint: if PyPI is reachable, check out wip/B1, run the full check, and merge if green.
- Next: B1 (needs package registry access for the cloud environment)
